<h1>The Oregon Film Festival Story</h1>
<h2>The Early Days</h2>
<p>The Oregon Film Festival was established in 2012 with the  simple idea: bring films to Oregon. Then the founders went beyond that notion  to call them independent films. Then they further complicated the idea by  discussing genres like local films, Northwest films, and maybe even U.S. films.  Then they really went outside the box with the idea that they'd bring in  international films, also known as foreign films to those of us in the  Northwest.</p>

<h2>Founder</h2>
<p><img src="assets/founder.jpg" width="400" height="286" alt="Robin Cheese-Marten"/></p>
<p>Robin Cheese-Marten (esq.) established the Oregon Film  Festival and began a long tradition of bringing obscure, non-traditional,  thought-consuming, and invocative films to the Oregon region. He didn't start  with a plan, but what he learned along the way became one. It was, as he put  it, really kind of neat.<br>
  Mr. Cheese-Marten (esq.) lives in his mother's old basement  which he plans to remodel someday. He and his iguana, Ernie, take great pride  in their rustic furniture and teapot collection.</p>
<h2>Mission and Goals</h2>
<p>To deliver the unexpected in film in surprising venues and  with surprising audience members. It's an event that will shape and mold you  like modeling clay. Your brain and even your heart are like the clay in this  analogy. <br>
&quot;We will reshape your head and your heart!&quot; is our  motto.</p>
<h2>Judging Procedures</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Watch the movies.</li>
  <li>Decide which one you like.</li>
  <li>Notify the founder of your choice.</li>
  <li>The founder then makes a decision which may or  may not be related to the judges' choices.</li>
</ol>
