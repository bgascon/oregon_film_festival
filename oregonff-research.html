  <li>I liked the Portland Film Festival website is the most appealling</li>
  <li>It has a great color palette and the design in flat, clean and well organized. The navigation is clear and the have current news and events beneath the header.</li>
  <li>The logo does return you to the homepage.</li>
  <li>I think it just has a nicer layout. On first glance the other two pages are a little confusing, and it's hard to tell where to go for what I would want.</li>
  <li>I would make the Twitter and Facebook links a little more visible. It took me a few scans to even notice they were there.</li>
  <li>The large header image and information panel is really useful. I think incorporating something like that would be good.</li>
